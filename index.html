I am a PhD student in the <a href = "http://www.stat.cmu.edu/">Department of Statistics and Data Science</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. My current research interests lie in statistical methodology, statistical machine learning, and fairness, accountability and transparency in machine learning.
<br><br>
I graduated with a Master of Science in Mathematics from the University of Freiburg in 2018. Before that, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Economics (2017) and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (2015) from the same university.
