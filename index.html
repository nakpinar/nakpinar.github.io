<br>
I am a PhD student in the joint program between the <a href = "http://www.stat.cmu.edu/">Department of Statistics and Data Science</a> and the <a href = "https://www.ml.cmu.edu/">Machine Learning Department</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests lie in statistical methodology, machine learning in high-stakes decision settings, and fairness, accountability and transparency in machine learning.
<br><br>
I graduated with a Master of Science in Mathematics from the <a href = "http://www.uni-freiburg.de/">University of Freiburg</a> in Germany in 2018. Before that, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Economics (2017) and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (2015) from the University of Freiburg.
