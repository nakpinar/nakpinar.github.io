My name is Nil-Jana Akpinar, and I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My current research interests lie in statistical methodology, statistical machine learning, and fairness, accountability and transparency in machine learning.

I graduated with a Master of Science in Mathematics from the University of Freiburg in 2018. Before that, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Economics (2017) and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (2015) from the same university.
